# Basic ERC20Token
A simple, burnable ERC20 token with a 100 million fixed supply. 

Token also has the ability to create block rewards to distribute new supply to miners.

I plan on expanding the functionality of this token when I have the time. For now it simply acts as a reference point for future implementations.

Contracts and tests inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gc7e90MHvl8&list=LL&index=5&t=2s_).
